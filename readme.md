# **Salishan Languages Keyboard Support**

**Salishan** is a **keyboard layout for Salishan and neighboring Indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest**. It extends the standard English keyboard with **dead keys for glottalization, acute accent, tilde, and other diacritics**, enabling efficient typing of **ejective, glottalized, and lateral consonants**, as well as **special vowels** used across multiple Salishan languages. The layout also includes **combining diacritics for rare tonal or phonetic markings**, making it a comprehensive tool for **linguists, language learners, and community members**.
